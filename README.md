# Sparse-UNet

Sparse-UNet is a cutting-edge image segmentation model that integrates Sparse Attention mechanisms with the U-Net architecture. This hybrid approach aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of image segmentation tasks by focusing computational resources on the most relevant regions of the image.

Sparse-UNet aims to leverage the benefits of Sparse Attention within the U-Net framework to enhance the performance of image segmentation models. The Sparse Attention mechanism helps in focusing on important regions of the image, thus enhancing the segmentation accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

## Model Architecture

The Sparse-UNet architecture is designed to efficiently handle high-resolution images and complex segmentation tasks. It combines the U-Net's encoder-decoder structure with Sparse Attention blocks to create a powerful and efficient model.

### Key Components:

1. **Encoder**:
    - Uses convolutional layers to extract features from the input image.
    - Includes Sparse Attention blocks to focus on relevant regions, improving feature extraction efficiency.

2. **Bottleneck**:
    - Acts as a bridge between the encoder and decoder.
    - Enhances the feature representation using Sparse Attention.

3. **Decoder**:
    - Utilizes transposed convolutions to upsample the features and reconstruct the image.
    - Incorporates Sparse Attention blocks to refine the segmentation output.

4. **Final Layer**:
    - Produces the segmentation map with a single convolutional layer.

### Sparse Attention:

The Enhanced Sparse Attention mechanism is a crucial component of the architecture. It improves the model's focus on important regions of the image by:
- Reducing the number of irrelevant computations.
- Increasing the attention span over significant areas.
- Enhancing the overall performance and efficiency of the model.

### Preparing the Dataset
Place your training and validation datasets in the datasets/train and datasets/val directories respectively. The directory structure should look like this:

```
datasets/
    train/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
    val/
        class1/
        class2/
        ...
    test/
  ```  
### Results
The results of the model training and validation will be printed to the console. The final model weights will be saved to the models directory.
